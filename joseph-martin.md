# Joseph Martin's Demo File

Hi! This is an example Markdown file that will be imported into and presented on the [Learn LMS](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/). 

Learn supports all the basic Markdown syntax including:
1. Lists
    - nested lists
2. [Links](#)
3. _italicized_ and **bolded** text
4. `code highlights`
5. and even...
    > blockquotes

But if you want to do fancier formatting, Learn has you covered with many extra features!
